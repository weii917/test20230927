                <p>I've been reading books of old<br>
                    The legends and the myths<br>
                    Achilles and his gold<br>
                    Hercules and his gifts<br>
                    Spiderman's control<br>
                    And Batman with his fists<br>
                    And clearly I don't see myself upon that list<br>
                    <br>
                    But she said, where d'you wanna go?<br>
                    How much you wanna risk?<br>
                    I'm not looking for somebody<br>
                    With some superhuman gifts<br>
                    Some superhero<br>
                    Some fairytale bliss<br>
                    Just something I can turn to<br>
                    Somebody I can kiss<br>
                    <br>
                    I want something just like this<br>

                    A suit before he lifts<br>
                    But I'm not the kind of person that it fits<br>

                作曲:Robert Lopez</h4>

            <div class="song">
                <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonightbr<br>
                    Not a footprint to be seenbr <br>
                    A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queenbr <br>
                    The wind is howling like this swirling storm insidebr<br>
                    Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>
                    <br>
                    Don't let them in<br>
                    Don't let them seebr <br>
                    Be the good girl you always have to bebr <br>
                    Conceal, don't feelbr<br>
                    Don't let them knowbr<br>
                    Well, now they knowbr<br>
                    <br>
                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    Can't hold it back anymorebr <br>
                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    Turn away and slam the doorbr<br>
                    I don't care what they're going to saybr <br>
                    Let the storm rage on<br>
                    The cold never bothered me anyway<br>
                    <br>
                    It's funny how some distanceb<br>
                    Makes everything seem smallbr<br>
                    And the fears that once controlled me<br>
                    Can't get to me at allbr <br>

                    It's time to see what I can dobr <br>
                    To test the limits and break throughb<br>
                    <br>
                    No right, no wrong, no rules for mebr<br>
                    I'm free!<br>

                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    I am one with the wind and skybr <br>
                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    You'll never see me crybr<br>
                    Here I stand and here I'll staybr<br>
                    Let the storm rage on<br>
                    <br>
                    My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
                    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all aroundbr <br>
                    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blastbr <br>
                    I'm never going back. The past is in the past<br>
                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    And I'll rise like the break of dawnb<br>
                    Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                    That perfect girl is gone<br>
                    Here I stand in the light of dayb<br>
                    Let the storm rage on!br <br>
                    The cold never bothered me anyway
