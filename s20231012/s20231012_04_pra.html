            <p>Yeah get up and move your feet<br>
                So close that you can taste it<br>
                Feel the punch of your heartbeat<br>
                It's time to get this done<br>
                You know just what you're risking<br>
                Won't stop 'til this battle's won<br>
                Who are you?
                When blasts of thunder crash and rage<br>
                like you've never seen
                Cause no one else can meet them<br>
                head on like you do
                Cause no one else is like you<br>
                From the darkest night you know that<br>
                soon hope will shine through<br>
                Cause no one else is like you <br>

                Danger rears its head, but in the end<br>
                your heart was meant to ring true<br>
                What lies ahead is grim
                It's tough, but you can take it<br>
                Grit your teeth, and you'll push through<br>
                Yeah no one else is like you<br>
                There is nothing you can't do<br>
                Cause no one else is like you<br>
                Yeah sometimes you'll find it's hard<br>
                Lonely to be a hero
                Lift your head and don't look back<br>
                If they blame it all on you<br>
                Stand up and be their hero<br>
                Trust in what you know is true<br>
                There's nothing you can't do<br>
                There's no one else like you</p>

            <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonightbr<br>
                Not a footprint to be seenbr <br>
                A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queenbr <br>
                The wind is howling like this swirling storm insidebr<br>
                Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>
                
                Don't let them in<br>
                Don't let them seebr <br>

                Can't hold it back anymorebr <br>
                Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                Turn away and slam the doorbr<br>
                I don't care what they're going to saybr <br>
                Let the storm rage on<br>
                The cold never bothered me anyway<br>
                
                It's funny how some distanceb<br>
                Makes everything seem smallbr<br>
                And the fears that once controlled me<br>
                Can't get to me at allbr <br>
                
                It's time to see what I can dobr <br>
                To test the limits and break throughb<br>
                
                No right, no wrong, no rules for mebr<br>

                My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
                My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all aroundbr <br>
                And one thought crystallizes like an icy blastbr <br>
                I'm never going back. The past is in the past<br>
                Let it go! Let it go!<br>
                And I'll rise like the break of dawnb<br>
